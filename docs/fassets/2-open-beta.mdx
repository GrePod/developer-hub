The FAssets system is currently in the open-beta period on the Coston test network.
To ensure a seamless experience for open-beta participants, the FAssets codebase was updated based on the results of the closed-beta period.

The open-beta period currently supports minting and redeeming XRP and BTC assets.

## Objectives

* Test the FAssets system in a live environment
* Gather feedback from users to improve the FAssets functionality and documentation
* Continue the education of the various roles supporting FAssets, such as [agents](./overview#agents), [liquidators](./overview#liquidators), and [challengers](./overview#challengers), so that they can get practical experience and prepare themselves for the general launch of the FAssets system
* Identify and resolve any remaining inconsistencies to ensure the system is as robust as possible before adding real user funds

## Phases

* **Phase One**: Agents will be onboarded and can interact with the FAssets system only via the command-line interface.
* **Phase Two**: A graphical user interface will be released for everyone to use instead of the command line.

After the Coston open beta ends, FAssets will launch on the Songbird network.

| **Discount for agent self-close**<br />In self-close exit, the pool token holder burns FAssets to increase pool CR enough to enable exit. Normally, the burned FAssets are redeemed in the normal redemption process. However, if the closed amount is less than 1 lot, or on explicit request, the agent buys the underlying assets (at a discounted FTSO price, to compensate the agent for possible price fluctuations) and pays the exiting token holder in vault collateral.<br /> | 1%    | 1%    |
